## üîç What Is a Network Media Converter?

A **network media converter** is a device that enables the conversion of signals between two different types of media‚Äîtypically between twisted pair (RJ45) Ethernet and fiber optic cabling. It allows legacy copper networks to extend over fiber, enhancing speed, distance, and EMI resistance without a complete infrastructure overhaul.
